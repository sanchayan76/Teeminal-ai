# Terminal AI Assistant – Solace 🤖

Solace is a terminal-based AI assistant designed to help users with day-to-day tasks, especially terminal and command-line operations. Powered by Google's Gemini API, she acts like a calm, emotionally intelligent elder sister — supportive, witty, and never clingy.
